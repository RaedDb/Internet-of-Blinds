# Internet-of-Blinds

Internet of Blinds or IoB is dedicated to helping blind people and assisting them in different ways using Neural Networks and Deep Learning architectures, as this project consists of 4 main parts. 

The First part was the virtual assistant, this assistant was used to convert a live user's voice to commands, extracting entities from the commands, running classes related to those entities, and responding to the user with an intelligent command which will be transformed to a sound and fed to user's ear. 

The second part was the live object detection algorithm that will be assisting the user with avoiding obstacles, informing him/her about traffic lights, stairs, doors, recognizing objects in front of them, and recognizing text. 

The third part was the safety system, as this system will be calling emergency organizations if something went wrong with the user (falling or heart attack).

The last part was the deployment of all models, as all of our models have been deployed on the cloud so that we will be able to trigger them out and update them accordingly, thus all of the used models will be updated automatically on the end devices. 


In this repository most of the programming code will be here, and if you need any help feel free to contact me on my email and i will be more than happy to help.
